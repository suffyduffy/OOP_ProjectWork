## INF1009 Object Oriented Programming Part 2 Team Project

Thank you for stopping by! :)

This repository was completed in fulfilment for INF1009 Object Oriented Programming Part 2 Team Project (2024). This is a Java project utilizing libGDX library. <br><br>

## Project Deliverables:
In part 1, our requirements included exhibited game engine implementation, showcasing the implementation of Simulation Lifecycle Management, Scene Management, Entity, Collisions, AI Control, Player Control and Input Control. In part, we worked on our game layer while ensuring we applied the java design patterns concept.  <br><br>

<br><br>


## Build Instuctions:
There is no need for any additional software or modules besides Java installed on your system and an IDE that can import using the Github version control.
If you wish to manually import the files, you will need to include the libGDX library in your project dependencies or build a libGDX project and manually copy the files over.<br><br>

## How it works
1. Use left, right keys to control the man.
2. When you the man eats healthy food he becomes chad and when he eats unhealthy food, he become fat. Your healthy food score and time remaining will increase when the man eats healthy food. But ONLY the time remaining will decrease when he eats unhealthy food
3. You may press P during the gameplay to reach the pause screen if necessary
